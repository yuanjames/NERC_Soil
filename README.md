# Explainable Artificial Intelligence approaches to understand and communicate spatial and temporal patterns of toxic chemicals

There are 183 samples in total, but 4 outliers were dropped. 

## Experiment 1
After categorical data are transformed into one-hot encoding, the number of total available features is 87. However, compared with the data amount, the feature number may be too much. Therefore, we used first 8 features to conduct experiments with the purpose of explaining the neural network used to predicting DEHP. Meanwhile, we repeated 3 three times in order to reduce the impact of potential unstable factors.
